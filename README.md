# REST_API_BOT

## Description
REST_API_BOT is a Discord bot template designed for handling REST APIs. Itâ€™s built using Python and is available for free use.

## Instructions

### Setup Your Bot:
1. Open `rest-api-bot.py`.
2. Locate the line `bot.run("TOKEN_HERE")` (usually at the end of the file).
3. Replace `"TOKEN_HERE"` with your own Discord Bot token.

### Virtual Environment:
To start the bot, youâ€™ll need to create a virtual environment. Iâ€™ve provided some batch scripts to simplify the process:

1. Run `1.install-environment.bat` to set up the environment.
2. Run `2.activate-environment.bat` to activate it.

### Start the Bot:
In the terminal where `activate-environment.bat` is open, execute `3.start-bot.bat` or drag the script into the terminal.

Following these steps, everything should work smoothly.
